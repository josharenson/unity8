This tool can be used to browse the menus of another application

How to use:
 * Start application that exports menus
    e.g. QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=ubuntuappmenu kate
 * Figure out which is the dbus address
   * This is a bit tricky, but using qdbusviewer to see the addresses
     that appear when starting the app and looking for one that
     contains com/Ubuntu/Menu/0 should be enough
 * Start tool passing the dbus address
    builddir/menutool/menutool :1.293
