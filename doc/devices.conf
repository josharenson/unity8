# This file can hold multiple device configs. Devices are separated by sections.
#
# SupportedOrientations holds a list of all enabled orientations. A standard
# phone will usually have Portrait,Landcape,InvertedLandscape in order to
# disable upside down usage.
#
# PrimaryOrientation gives the orientation the device will start up with
# when there is no orientations sensor input available (yet) or lock to
# when an application specifies to be locked to PrimaryOrientation.
#
# The other Orientation settings can be used to re-map the orientations.
# A device might be used with different orientations than how the screen
# is physically mounted on the hardware.
#
# Category can be phone, tablet, or desktop. This option determines
# whether the side stage is shown (tablet) or not (phone). Using
# desktop will load the shell in windowed mode. Note that the user
# can override/change this by connecting input hardware or change
# user settings.
#
# Any options not listed will default to the values of the example below.

# Example for the Nexus 7

# Example for the Nexus 4
# The screen is already mounted the way we want it, so no special config
# required. However, we don't want the phone to rotate upside down, so lets
# restrict that.
