/*
  Estimates the current velocity of a finger based on recent movement along an axis

  Taking an estimate from a reasonable number of samples, instead of only
  from its last movement, removes wild variations in velocity caused
  by the jitter normally present in input from a touchscreen.

  Usage example:

    AxisVelocityCalculator {
        id: velocityCalculator
        trackedPosition: myMouseArea.mouseX
    }

    MouseArea {
        id: myMouseArea

        onReleased: {
            console.log("Drag velocity along the X axis before release was: "
                        + velocityCalculator.calculate())
        }
    }
