  * Add --lightdm= argument to ./run.sh that lets developers choose
    which lightdm backend to use. Stop letting a user that is
    immediately denied via PAM into the shell by fixing some assumptions
    that a user which was not prompted was successfully authenticated.
    This is not a common situation, you'd have to manually change your
    PAM config. Fix a small console warning .
  * Make wrong-password handling much nicer by showing a pretty spinner
    while we wait for PAM, by improving the prompt text to match
    designs, by forcing the user to wait five seconds after every five
    failed attemps, and by supporting (but not yet enabling) an opt-in
    "factory-reset your phone after X failed attemps" feature.

  * Use the correct API in PageHeader. (LP: #1353048)
  * Refactor dash activity indicator. (LP: #1351539)

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * Dash Departments fixes Update maxHeight manually since it depends on
    the position of the item and its parents and it can't know when the
    binding has to be updated Make parent stuff non interactive when the
    department list is shown
  * PageHeader: when on search clip y-coordinates otherwise the
    background spills out when on search (LP: #1350398)

  * Hardcode art shape size for click scope local and predefined
    categories While at it, drop the fillmode of cards

  * Fixes for dash as app Load i18n catalog Process command line options
    Add the posibility to have a mouse touch adaptor (LP: #1353351)

    (LP: #1329204)

  * When the edge demo is running, don't show the greeter if the screen
    is turned off. This avoids an odd interaction where parts of the
    greeter are disabled but the edge demo isn't visible until you slide
    the greeter away. (LP: #1283425)
  * Don't hardcode the phablet password in our testing script.

  [ Ying-Chun Liu ]

    QQuickWindowPrivate::polishItems because LVWPH is deleting items to
    polish from it's updatePolish which means the set in

  * Move the PyDev project files to the root, supporting .py scripts
    outside of tests/autopilot. Add Autopilot Run and List launch
    configurations to easily support debugging in Eclipse. Use
    add_unity8_mock macro in the Telephony plugin.

  * Make headerless categories easier Instead of having no header
    category (which is a bit confusing since the LVWPH code was designed
    so that when a category has no header it is because it shares the
    category with the previous one) what we have for headerless
    categories is a header of height 0, this way everything works as it
    should and results in cleaner code in the LVWPH and in
    GenericScopeView
  * Add support for header links.
  * Add dash PageHeader styling.
