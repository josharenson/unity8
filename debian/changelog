  [ CI bot ]
  * Resync trunk

  [ Michał Sawicz ]
  * Fix the ap test for applications.

  * Use deleteLater instead of a direct delete We are seeing a crash in
    QQuickWindowPrivate::polishItems because LVWPH is deleting items to
    polish from it's updatePolish which means the set in
    QQuickWindowPrivate::polishItems may end up with some yet-to-
    process-but-now-deleted items. Switching to deleteLater fixes this

unity8 (7.90+14.10.20140724.1-0ubuntu1) utopic; urgency=low

  [ Michael Zanetti ]
  * properly parent launcher items (LP: #1347902)

  [ Michał Sawicz ]
  * Move the PyDev project files to the root, supporting .py scripts
    outside of tests/autopilot. Add Autopilot Run and List launch
    configurations to easily support debugging in Eclipse. Use
    add_unity8_mock macro in the Telephony plugin.
  * Drop FilterGrid and refactor height animations in GenericScopeView.
    Also implement forced category expansion. (LP: #1326470)
  * Move expansion button from section header to category footer. (LP:
    #1261300)
  * Fix expect-sigstop enviroment variable name. (LP: #1346819)
  * Make headerless categories easier Instead of having no header
    category (which is a bit confusing since the LVWPH code was designed
    so that when a category has no header it is because it shares the
    category with the previous one) what we have for headerless
    categories is a header of height 0, this way everything works as it
    should and results in cleaner code in the LVWPH and in
    GenericScopeView
  * Add support for header links.
  * Add dash PageHeader styling.
