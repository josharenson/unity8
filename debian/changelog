  * Fix 1195349 by counting drawbuffer on the newContentX logic of the
    carousel When we changed carousel from repeater to listview, we
    added drawbuffer. this breaks the logic of newContentX, which was
    considered disabled and set to -1. The correct disabled value now
    has to take into account the drawbuffer. (LP: #1195349)

  [ Daniel d'Andrada ]
  * Make Greeter and Stage use the new DragHandle component. So they no
    longer use Revealers. Now a directional drag gesture is required to
    start the animation that brings back a "minimized" application when
    the dash is on foreground. Besides that, now they have the following
    feature:  - Action only completes succesfully if you drag through at
    least half the    screen width or if your swipe is fast enough. The
    shorter the swipe, the faster it has to be for the action to auto-
    complete.
  * DirectionalDragArea: add touchSceneX, touchSceneY, and sceneDistance
    properties.
  * DirectionalDragArea: emit draggingChanged() on direct recognition
    draggingChanged() should be emited when status change from
    WaitingForTouch directly to Recognized.
  * update CODING instructions for building & running.
  * DragHandle: add stretch and hintDisplacement properties.
  * DragHandle: fix hinting Revision 64 had a bad interaction with
    revision 66 (that added line was lost in the merge/rebase process).
    tst_DragHandle::hintingAnimation() points out the problem (fails on
    line 388).
  * Make Panel use DragHandles instead of a Revealer - A directional
    drag gesture is needed reveal the panel when fullscreen. - better
    logic for deciding when to auto-complete the show/hide animation -
    hinting animation to close the panel - Tapping on menu bar no longer
    opens nearest indicator menu - No closing with handle click.

    onPressed and immediately snap back - fix edge hinting to not happen
