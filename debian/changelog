    emergency dialer will need this support in order to cancel bringing

  * Added unity-scope-tool, which will help when developing scopes.
  * Use full DashContent, not just GenericScopeView in ScopeTool.qml.
  * Bring Card and CardHeader over from new-scopes.
  * Work around bug #1268578. (LP: #1268578)
  * Drop unnecessary version dependencies.
  * Return null instead of undefined from findChild and
    findInvisibleChild.
  * Fix CardHeader and Card heights (empty Label does have non-zero
    height apparently). Also improve test robustness and reduce future
    diffs.

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * Do not assert if the item we are removing was not created yet
    (because e.g. it's not in the viewport).
  * Position correctly the pointer of the search history box .
  * Make test_filter_expand_expand less unstable in CI VMs Make sure
    header0 is the header0 we want to click On the CI VM stuff is a bit
    slower than on real hw and we were clicking in the wrong place.
  * Add TabBar to the Dash header navigation Changes this comes with: *
    DashBar at the bottom is gone * PageHeader doesn't have a Label
    anymore, it has the childItem property where you add which thing it
    has to contain * New: PageHeaderLabel mimics the old behaviour of
    PageHeader * The header of the LVWPH of GenericScopeView is now fake
    and only used for positioning. There is a single global floating
    header in DashContent (which is a PageHeader with a TabBar as
    childItem) * The GenericScopeView previewLoader and OpenEffect have
    been also moved to the DashContent so that the openEffect includes
    the floating header in the "animation" .
  * Introduce the HorizontalJournal.
  * If there are no items m_firstVisibleIndex has to be -1 .
  * Add some more documentation about tests to the CODING file.
  * Fixes to the journal cmake tests code * Output to the correct
    filename for the test * Don't output stuff from the tryXYZ targets.
  * Adapt to findChild return value changes .
  * Organic Grid for the Dash View.
  * Misc journal fixes Don't init *modelIndex to INT_MAX Makes no sense
    since we're not doing any qMin and the calling function also accepts
    any index >= 0 as valid so in some cases it may end up wanting to
    create an index that doesn't exist Don't refill if height() < 0,
    that gives bad ranges for from/to and the code gets confused .

  * Remove icons we don't use .
  * Do not start apps or go to dash on demo If you are pulling the

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * Fix time test in Qt 5.2 Make factors an array instead of a
    object/dict Objects/dicts are unordered by definition, it happened
    that Qt 5.0 gave them in the orrder we wanted, but with Qt 5.2 is
    failing, and we don't even need the "key", so array works as well
    :).
  * Test that the dash hswipe is disabled while the inner stuff is
    moving .
  * Skip restMaximizeVisibleAreaMoveUpAndShowHeader, it's causing too
    many failed runs And we are confident it's failing because of the
    suboptimal scenegraph run in 5.0.x.
  * Make Dash::test_show_scope_on_load more robust If we are testing
    showScopeOnLoaded make sure we force a scope reload after we set it,
    otherwise it may just happen that the scope has already been loaded
    and the expectaction that we'll change the list to it is just wrong.
  * Dash renderer signals: No need to pass the model up and down Whoever
    is listening to the signal has access to the item that emits the
    signal and has the model right there accessible if needs it.
  * LVWPH: Fix header going bad when setContentHeight ends up moving the
    viewport How to reproduce the bug easily without the patch: * In the
    Dash Home, search for london * Scroll to the bottom * Start moving
    to the apps scope very slowly * At around 3/4 of the move you'll see
    the header in the home scope went to a bad position * Go back to the
    Dash Home. (LP: #1237942, #1246351)

  * Remove unused Time.js and its test .
  * Do not include the QtQml megaheader Include only qqml.h which is
    what we need in these files.
  * Don't do stuff if our parent context is gone We'll be gone soon too
    (and crash probably) so don't do anything. This looks a bit like a
    workaround, wait for 5.2 better painting/dispatching loop to see if

    decide this is fine.

    state machine. Added compositionTime property. Multi-finger
    scenarios are better handled now. Refactored TimeSource in
    Ubuntu.Gestures plugin. Added an easy way to debug
    DirectionalDragArea by having switchable debug prints. Updated tests
    to also simulate the passage of time. Use touch point scene
    coordinates for gesture recognition so that moving the.
    DirectionalDragArea (as in a hinting DragHandle) won't affect it.
    (LP: #1228336)
  * Add right-edge drag hinting to Greeter To match with the existing
    teasing animation when you tap on the right half of the Greeter.
    Also has the side benefit of making the code look a bit nicer.
  * Refactor Ubuntu.Gesture tests to share common logic Take the common
    part out of tst_DirectionalDragArea and put it into a separate base
    class, GestureTest, so that it can be shared with other, future,
    tests. In CMakeLists.txt, create a macro out of DirectionalDragArea
    build script to be used by future tests with similar requirements
    and structure. Also add the "m_" prefix to member variables.
  * Remove dead code from Utils plugin They are not being used anywhere.

    really care about, not an indirect indicator of it. (LP: #1248232)

  * Fix bug when setting the same model twice to a QLimitProxyModelQML.
  * Add some const & Saves us some microseconds in copying stuff.

  [ Daniel d'Andrada ]
  * Make Greeter and Stage use the new DragHandle component. So they no
    longer use Revealers. Now a directional drag gesture is required to
    start the animation that brings back a "minimized" application when
    the dash is on foreground. Besides that, now they have the following
    feature:  - Action only completes succesfully if you drag through at
    least half the    screen width or if your swipe is fast enough. The
    shorter the swipe, the faster it has to be for the action to auto-
    complete.
  * DirectionalDragArea: add touchSceneX, touchSceneY, and sceneDistance
    properties.
  * DirectionalDragArea: emit draggingChanged() on direct recognition
    draggingChanged() should be emited when status change from
    WaitingForTouch directly to Recognized.
  * update CODING instructions for building & running.
  * DragHandle: add stretch and hintDisplacement properties.
  * DragHandle: fix hinting Revision 64 had a bad interaction with
    revision 66 (that added line was lost in the merge/rebase process).
    tst_DragHandle::hintingAnimation() points out the problem (fails on
    line 388).
  * Make Panel use DragHandles instead of a Revealer - A directional
    drag gesture is needed reveal the panel when fullscreen. - better
    logic for deciding when to auto-complete the show/hide animation -
    hinting animation to close the panel - Tapping on menu bar no longer
    opens nearest indicator menu - No closing with handle click.

  [ mhall119 ]

  * As requested by design, decreasing wobblyness in the
    WrongPasswordAnimation.
  * improve the bzr commit hook - don't run qmltests in here, it takes
    too long - don't abort commit on failed tests, its too annoying -
    instead, print a fat warning and backup the commit message to be
    reused after uncommitting and fixing the tests.
  * edge hinting tweaks - change edge hinting behavior to only happen on
    onPressed and immediately snap back - fix edge hinting to not happen
    if the Greeter is locked .

  [ Michael Terry ]
  * Fix "Tap to Unlock" text not appearing when in tablet greeter mode
    with only one user.
